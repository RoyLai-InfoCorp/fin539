    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the \"skeleton\" structure from the github repository `https://git@github.com/RoyLai-InfoCorp/fin579`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    DAPP development involves a large part of HTML and CSS apart from Javascript. To focus on the Smart Contract interaction logic, we will use a pre-built Javascript React project which you are downloading from github for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ git clone https://git@github.com/RoyLai-InfoCorp/fin579\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create `lab-11` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ md lab-11;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Copy the `fin579-dapp-skeleton` directory from the `fin579` repository into the `lab-11` directory and rename it as `dapp`. The directory structure should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ mv fin579/fin579-dapp-skeleton lab-11/dapp\n",
    "    $ cd lab-11/dapp\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    /public\n",
    "    /src\n",
    "    package.json\n",

    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ npm i\n",

    "    There is no need to make changes to the `App.js` file or understand the UI logic. The UI logic will make use of the 6 functions in the `dapp.js` to interact with the uniswap contracts.\n",

And implement the `sellTokens` function to trade between DAI and TUT. The remaining `buyToken` function will be implemented on your own as part of your ECA assignment.\n"
