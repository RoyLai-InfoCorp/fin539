# OpenZeppelin Smart Contract Library

## 1. Intro

In the previous labs, you have created your own ERC20 smart contract from scratch for learning purposes but in practse we generally use the Openzepppelin library as a basis for our smart contract development. OpenZeppelin provides most of the standard ERC smart contracts (including ERC20) that are implemented based on industry best practises which makes it safer to use and adopt. In this lesson, we will replace our ERC20 token using the OpenZeppelin libraries.
