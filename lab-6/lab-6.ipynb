Since ownership is a rather generic function, we will create a standalone `Ownership` contract. This contract can subsequently be used by the TutorialContract via multiple inheritance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 5.  Create `onlyOwner` modifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following modifier to the contract. A modifier is a syntactic sugar that lets you attach code to the beginning or end of a function. The basic use case is used for validation purpose like in this case, used to check if the caller is contract owner. The advantage is that onlyOwner can be added as a modifier to any function instead of repeating the same if then statement.\n",
