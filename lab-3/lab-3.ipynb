    "In this lab, you will signup an account with a third-party node provider that provide access to Ethereum Clients connected to public network. We then obtain some test ETH and use it to test the sending of ETH transactions on testnet. In theory, you can install your own Ethereum Client running a public node. But for practicality sake, most will connect via an external party that already have nodes running on the live networks. For this course, we will be using Alchemy as the node provider and Goerli for our testnet.\n",
